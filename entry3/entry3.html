		<h2>Mt. Hood Skibowl: The Ultimate Playground for Night Skiing & Adventurers</h2>
		<p>If you’re looking for steep terrain, night skiing, and an adrenaline-packed experience, Mt. Hood Skibowl is the place to be. Known as "America’s Largest Night Ski Area," this resort delivers a rugged, no-frills ski experience with some of the most exciting terrain on Mt. Hood.</p>
		
		<h3>A No-Frills, All-Thrills Resort</h3>
		<p>Unlike Timberline’s historic charm or Mt. Hood Meadows’ expansive terrain, Skibowl is all about steep lines, quick laps, and budget-friendly fun. The vibe is casual and laid-back, drawing a mix of locals, freestyle riders, and expert skiers looking for a challenge.</p>

		<h3>Terrain & Snow Conditions</h3>
		<p><strong>Best for Advanced Skiers & Riders:</strong> With 60% of its runs rated black or double black, Skibowl is home to some of the steepest terrain in Oregon. The Upper Bowl offers incredible tree skiing, cliffs, and chutes, making it a dream for more aggressive riders.</p>
		<p><strong>Night Skiing Paradise:</strong> With 36 lighted runs, Skibowl offers an epic night skiing experience, making it a perfect after-work or budget-friendly option.</p>
		<p><strong>Snow Quality:</strong> Due to its lower elevation, snow conditions can be hit or miss, especially in warmer seasons. However, fresh powder days can be legendary.</p>

		<h3>Lifts, Crowds & Amenities</h3>
		<p><strong>Lifts:</strong> The resort operates a few chairlifts and rope tows, making it slower than high-speed lift resorts, but the short lines often make up for it.</p>
		<p><strong>Après-Ski & Dining:</strong> The historic Beer Stube serves up hearty food and strong drinks, making it a favorite for après-ski.</p>
		<p><strong>Lodging:</strong> No on-mountain lodging, but Government Camp is just minutes away with plenty of options.</p>
