		<h3>Atmosphere: A Resort with Character</h3>
		<p>Unlike modern large resorts, Timberline embraces its historic charm. The stunning, hand-crafted lodge, built in the 1930s, sets the stage for an old-school ski experience. The atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming, making it a great destination for families, beginner and intermediate skiers, and even professional athletes training on the Palmer Snowfield in the summer.</p>

		<h3>Terrain & Snow Conditions</h3>
		<p>Timberline’s terrain caters primarily to beginners and intermediates, with wide, well-groomed runs and gentle slopes. While advanced riders may find limited steeps within the resort, the Palmer Glacier offers an amazing opportunity for summer skiing, making Timberline one of the only year-round ski destinations in North America.</p>

		<p>The snowfall is consistent throughout winter, ensuring reliable conditions, and the resort’s high elevation means longer seasons than most ski areas in the Pacific Northwest.</p>

		<h3>Lifts, Crowds & Amenities</h3>
		<p>With a mix of high-speed and slower chairlifts, wait times are generally short, except on peak weekends. The resort features ski-in/ski-out lodging at Timberline Lodge, offering rustic charm, fireplaces, and stunning views. Dining options range from fine dining at the Cascade Dining Room to casual après-ski at the Blue Ox Bar.</p>

		<h3>Value for Money</h3>
		<p>Timberline’s lift tickets are reasonably priced, especially compared to larger resorts, and season passes offer excellent value for frequent visitors.</p>

		<h3>Overall</h3>
		<p>If you’re looking for a ski resort with a laid-back atmosphere, rich history, and the rare opportunity to ski year-round, Timberline Lodge is a must-visit.</p>
